# Fundamental_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_Programming
All projects, tasks and assignments done while coursing the class Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms Programming (C++).. 

The most important and elaborated folder is still in the making but it will be a program that will be able to detect a BotNet. This project will use Object Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, attributes, methods, inheritance, composition, pointers, polymorphism, ADT (Advanced Data Types) and search and sorting algorithms. Some of this can already be seen in the activities shown.
